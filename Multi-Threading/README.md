# Wall-E-Autonomous-Rover
This repository contains software that allows a rover to drive autonomously using a GPS and a magnetometer. The software also includes an embedded Radio communication system, which sends data to a remote ground control station. The data is then displayed on a python GUI. The repository also contains the software required to setup the Ground Control System and corresponding GUI.

# Libraries
